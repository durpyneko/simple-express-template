# Simple express.js template

Redid my express template from a while ago for newbies

## NOTE
[W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is the GOAT for examples

I also recommend getting the [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) VS Code extension for this template

## Quickstart
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have:

> An [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), I preferably use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
>
> [Git](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_getstarted.asp) or [Github Desktop (Windows and MacOS only afaik)](https://desktop.github.com/) installed
>
> A [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal) ready
>
> [Nodejs and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed

##
1. Clone the repo
> Using git:
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/durpyneko/simple-express-template
> ```
> Using Github Desktop: [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)

2. Open your IDE of choice in the directory you cloned into. Github Desktop has a quick launch feature

3. Open your terminal in the directory or use your IDE's built in terminal.
4. Install dependencies by running ->
  ```
  npm install
  ```
5. Start the server by running ->
  ```
  node index.js
  ```
6. Open the default url: `http://127.0.0.1:4000`
